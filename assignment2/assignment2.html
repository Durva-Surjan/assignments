                This is an example of Internal CSS.An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
                 An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.
            </p>
            <p class="external">
                This is an example of External CSS.The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages.
                 It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file.
